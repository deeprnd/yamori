Tickoni release notes template.

Use this template for roadmap release documents under
`doc/strategy/roadmap/releases/`.

This template is based on `doc/strategy/roadmap/releases/m1.md`, which is the
current source of truth for how Tickoni release notes are written:

1. Start with a short "What Progressed In The Story" recap.
2. State plainly what the user can do now.
3. Offer a jump link for readers who want the changelog first.
4. Continue the Tickoni story with an "Episode" section.
5. Switch into concrete release notes with grouped sections:
   - Headline Features
   - Governance and Safety
   - Platform Work
   - Demo
   - What Comes Next

This is not a generic engineering changelog template. It is a product release
template with a story layer first and a factual release-note layer second.

Release label conventions:
  - Milestone release: `M{N}`
  - Epic release: `VX.Y`
  - Story release: `VX.Y.SN`
  - Task release: `VX.Y.SN.TN` (rare; usually too small for this template)
  - Hotfix release: use `Hotfix` or the approved patch label

Examples:
  - `M1 — The Paper Moon`
  - `V5.26 — Portfolio Guardrails`
  - `V6.6.S2 — Snapshot Review Surface`
  - `Hotfix — Replay Hash Repair`

How to build the content from roadmap work:
  - "What Progressed In The Story" should summarize what changed across the
    shipped stories, not list internal tasks.
  - "The user can now" bullets should be direct, observable outcomes.
  - "Headline Features" should group the biggest user-visible capabilities from
    the included stories. Keep this to 2-4 main features.
  - "Governance and Safety" should capture policy, audit, replay, no-bypass,
    approval, boundary, and fail-closed improvements. Keep this to 2-4 main
    improvements.
  - "Platform Work" should capture runtime, topology, tooling, setup, and
    infrastructure hardening that materially supports the release. Keep this to
    2-4 main improvements.
  - "Demo" should give one concrete command or flow that proves the release.
  - "What Comes Next" should point to the next major milestone and explain the
    next qualitative step in the product story.

Writing rules:
  - Keep the opening progress recap short and user-facing.
  - Keep the story episode as a continuation of the Tickoni lore, not as a
    marketing slogan dump.
  - Keep the release notes concrete and evidence-friendly.
  - Do not get lost in detail. Highlight only the most important, wow-level
    shipped outcomes.
  - Tie every section back to shipped roadmap stories, milestone scope, or
    observable product/runtime behavior.
  - Do not invent future execution authority, policy outcomes, or product
    capabilities that are not already decided in strategy docs.

Read before filling:
  - `doc/strategy/README.md`
  - `doc/strategy/roadmap/milestones/m{N}.md` for the release's milestone
  - included roadmap epic/story docs
  - `doc/knowledge/architecture.md`
  - `doc/knowledge/tile-topology.md` when platform/runtime work is included
  - `doc/execution/development.md`
  - `doc/execution/testing-tickoni.md`

## What Progressed In The Story

[One short paragraph describing what changed in this release in plain
user-facing language.]

The user can now:

to the actual release outcome.]

[Suggested shape:
Previously, in the [prior story location or state]...

[Set the scene.]
